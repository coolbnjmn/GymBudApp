“This app is about to revolutionize the college fitness landscape” <br>

		<h2>About Us</h2>
		We believe the biggest problem holding back students within the college fitness community is motivation. GymBud was developed by a group of friends at UCLA who found it difficult to get a time when they could work out together. And we soon realized, we aren’t the only ones experiencing this problem. 
		<br><br>
		We created GymBud to unite the college fitness community by making it easier to create workouts in a fun and supportive atmosphere. Given the rise of social networking services such as Facebook, Instagram,Twitter, and Tinder, our generation has become much more interconnected. And yet, the fitness space still remains socially fragmented and incohesive. We plan on changing that!
		<br><br>
		We all come from various athletic pursuits-- water polo, collegiate football, bodybuilding, endurance racing, and strive to live overall healthy lifestyles.  With individual backgrounds in programming, marketing, and operations, combined with a team entrepreneurial spirit, we created GymBud to make exercise fun and easy!
